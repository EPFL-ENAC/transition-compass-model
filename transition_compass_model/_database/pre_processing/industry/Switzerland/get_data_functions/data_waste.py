    # "Approximately 200,000 vehicles are withdrawn from circulation every year in Switzerland.
    # A large proportion of them are completely roadworthy or only have minor damage or faults.
    # These vehicles are classified as second-hand articles. They are often exported and sold on used car markets abroad."
    # so exports should be quite large (including the second hand), and within collected
    # re-use could be set of being low (as most of the re-use are exported). Though in our case re-use also include
    # re-use of parts, so possibly a value that is similar to EU27 might be good.

    # The number of vehicles processed in Swiss shredder plants continues to decline. Only a little over
    # 37,000 end-of-life vehicles were recycled in the year
    # under review – ten years ago the figure was as high
    # as 100,000. The fall can be attributed both to the
    # increasing age of the vehicles, as they are recycled
    # later, and to the higher share of exports compared
    # with before.

    # While the number of recycled vehicles is falling, the
    # declared quantity of automobile shredder residue
    # (ASR) is actually rising and now stands at 41,000
    # tonnes, 22.4 per cent of which comes from end-oflife vehicles. ASR is processed by a thermal technique
    # in waste incineration plants only, with 91 per cent
    # of incinerations taking place in Swiss plants. Overall,
    # ASR only accounts for one per cent of total incinerated waste. The recycling process does not end with
    # incineration, however: further valuable metals are
    # recovered from the filter dust and slag. At the same
    # time, the waste heat from the flue gases is used to
    # generate electricity and district heating.

    # TAKEN OFFROAD: all vehicles that exit stock
    # VEHICLES CANCELLED IN SWITZERLAND: all vehicles that become waste
    # VEHICLES SHREDDED IN SWITZERLAND: all vehicles that are shredded
    # difference between 2 above: An unknown number of deregistered vehicles are parked in garages, second-hand dealers and scrap yards

    # layer 1: TAKEN OFFROAD should be total, then VEHICLES CANCELLED should be collected, then uncollected like EU27,
    # then rest is export (littered zero)
    # layer 2: SHREDDED IN SWITZERLAND is all incineration (if we assume that a car weights 1.2 tonnes, then shredded 2024 is
    # 44.4 tonnes, and data on incineration in 2024 is 41 tonnes).
    # For recycling there is something but it must be little, so remaining of difference between cancelled and shredded can be assigned
    # to either second hand or landfil (with numbers similar to EU, or can use Déchets spéciaux suisses)
