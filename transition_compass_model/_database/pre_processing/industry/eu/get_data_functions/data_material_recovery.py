    # Industry believes that the re-use and recycling of second raw materials is important as well. In fact,
    # this is already part of the business models of many vehicle manufacturers today. Throughout the 19
    # years that HDVs have been outside the scope of the ELV Directive, the vehicle recycling industry
    # has handled, treated and de-polluted trucks and buses in a way similar to passenger cars and thus
    # basically already applies existing environmental legislation to HDVs.

    # High recovery rates are reported by manufacturers for the case of aircraft that have been retired in the last decade.
    # For aircraft reaching their EoL during the last decade (with a high share of metals in their structure), recovery rates of
    # around 95% can be achieved by recyclers. These high recovery rates involve the use of downcycling and dealing with aircraft
    # that have a high percentage of metallic parts. Thus, for the case of recent aircraft models containing a significant
    # percentage of composite structural parts, which will enter the EoL phase in the future, new recycling technologies will
    # be required in order to keep the high reusability and recyclability rates.
    # put same recovery rates than trains (the recovery rates will be similar by material, i.e. aluminium high, composites low, etc).
